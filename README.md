# **Lung Cancer Survival Prediction**

## **Overview**
This repository demonstrates a technical workflow for predicting one-year survival outcomes for lung cancer patients. The project combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning to develop robust models using clinical and genomic datasets.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values in clinical data.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Normalizing continuous variables for uniform scaling.
  - Creating target variables for classification.
  - Merging and integrating genomic data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Addressing class imbalance.
  - Identifying correlations and redundancy in features.
  - Analyzing non-linear relationships using Mutual Information and PCA.
  - Ranking feature importance using Random Forest.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: A tree-based model for interpretable predictions.
  - **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A non-linear model to capture complex relationships.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
